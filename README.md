# Mudritha

~~Mudritha is currently just a very unsecure echo server, 
pretty much, with a DB to hold what people are saying.~~

In the future, I hope it'll become a newsreader, an HN clone 
for Sri Lankan news (grandiose ambitions seem to be a thing)

# Setup

Clone the repo, go inside and run `yarn install`. You can use 
the following commands after that:

```
yarn start
    Starts the development server.

yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
```
