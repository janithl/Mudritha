# Mudritha

Mudritha is currently just a very unsecure echo server, 
pretty much, with a DB to hold what people are saying.

In the future, I hope it'll become a newsreader, an HN clone 
for Sri Lankan news (grandiose ambitions seem to be a thing)

# Setup

Clone the repo, install Flask (`sudo pip intall Flask`). Copy 
sampleconfig.py to mudconfig.py and change the variables in there 
to secure your server. Then run `python mudritha.py` and open up a 
browser at `http://localhost:5000` and start playing!
